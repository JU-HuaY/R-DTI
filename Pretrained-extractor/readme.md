SPDNet relies on extensive singular value decomposition (SVD) operations to represent proteins. As a result, pre-training often involves frequent switching between CPU and GPU, resulting in relatively long training times. However, this has minimal impact on the efficiency of model inference. 
Our upcoming work will explore a new strategy to overcome this training limitation. ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
